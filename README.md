A simple nuking mod for removing large amounts of terrian. Built for use mainly on 2b2t.org.

To use the mod, type "&&enable" into chat and it should respond with a message.

Editing the config is simple, and you can view all the different settings by typing "&&list" into chat.

Capital letters dont matter and to find more information about a setting you can type "&&" and then the setting name without any spaces to see the available options.

Changing a settings is as simple as typing "&&" and then the setting name, followed by the value of the setting. Once again, capital letters dont make a difference.

This is essentially a paste from a module i was working on in a different client but people seem to want it so i thought id make it standalone. If there's any issues with it or features you'd like me to add, my discord is beanbag44.

Nuker now works as a plugin / addon for Rusherhack and Meteor Client, just make sure if the mod is being used as a rusherhack plugin to not load it as standalone / meteor addon at the same time otherwise your game will crash on boot. It is the same jar for every use case, the only difference is where you put it, for meteor and standalone just run it as a mod, and for rusherhack, place it in your rusherhack plugins folder. Instructions for enabling plugins can be found in the rusherhack plugins-dev channel https://discord.com/channels/590970327870341143/1166486609479356516/1166486759077584916
