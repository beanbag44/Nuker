A simple nuking mod for removing large amounts of terrian. Built for use mainly on 2b2t.org.

To use the mod, type "&&enable" into chat and it should respond with a message.

Editing the config is simple, and you can view all the different settings by typing "&&list" into chat.

Capital letters dont matter and to find more information about a setting you can type "&&" and then the setting name without any spaces to see the available options.

Changing a settings is as simple as typing "&&" and then the setting name, followed by the value of the setting. Once again, capital letters dont make a difference.

This is essentially a paste from a module i was working on in a different client but people seem to want it so i thought id make it standalone. If there's any issues with it or features you'd like me to add, my discord is beanbag44.

Now works as a plugin / addon for Rusherhack and Meteor Client, just make sure if the mod is being used as a rusherhack plugin to not load it as standalone / meteor addon at the same time otherwise your game will crash on boot.

Full credit goes to Icetank and his Litematica Printer for the freelook and movement handler [https://github.com/IceTank/litematica-printer]. Without these the rotations would have been incredibly goofy.
