A simple nuking mod for removing large amounts of terrian.

To use the mod, type "&&enable" into chat and it should respond with a message.

Editing the config is simple, and you can view all the different settings by typing "&&list" into chat.

Capital letters dont matter and to find more information about a setting you can type "&&" and then the setting name without any spaces to see the available options

Changing a settings is as simple as type "&&" and then the setting name, followed by the value of the settting. Once again, capital letters dont make a difference.
